# AnonCreds: Anonymous credentials protocol implementation in python
[![Build Status](https://jenkins.evernym.com/buildStatus/icon?job=Anoncreds/stable)](https://jenkins.evernym.com/view/Core/job/Anoncreds/job/stable/)

This is a python implementation of the anonymous credentials ideas developed by
IBM Research (see https://idemix.wordpress.com/ and
http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/zurich/idemix/). We have built some additional
features for revocation.

Anonymous Credentials requires a cryptographic framework. We have tested it with charm-crypto.
